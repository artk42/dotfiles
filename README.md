Dotfiles, scripts, and other bits and pieces.

Many of the things here were scavenged from the homedirs of other users of the shared unix boxes on which I've been lucky enough to have accounts, stack overflow posts, and the internet at large.

My eternal gratitude goes out to all those who share tidbits of scripts, and tasty little snacks of configuration.
